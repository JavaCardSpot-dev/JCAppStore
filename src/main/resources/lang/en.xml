    <string id="171">This card has been initialized. <!--todo desctibe--></string>
    <string id="172">Card is in secured state.</string>
    <string id="173"><p>This card has been secured. This means that the card has been marked as ready to work in
        hostile environment. We cannot work with such a card and the transformation process is irreversible.</p></string>
    <string id="174">Card is in locked state.</string>
    <string id="175"><p>Card is in locked state. It means that no management alternations can be performed and
        no other applet or security domain can be selected - the card can run only one selected applet. We cannot work
        with such a card and the transformation process is irreversible.</p></string>
    <string id="176">Card is in terminated state.</string>
    <string id="177"><p>Card has been terminated. It means that this card will not respond to almost any command and
        thus the card is useless. Nor we, nor anyone else can work with such a card and the transformation process
        is irreversible.</p></string>
    <string id="178">Card life cycle state not detected.</string>
    <string id="179"><p>Card life cycle state can tell us whether the card is ready for installing, deleteing and other
    management, or whether the card is no longer manageable. We were unable to determine this information and
    therefore we will not support this card to avoid any possible damage. Re-plugging the card could help, as fetching card info might (rarely) fail.</p></string>
    <string id="180">Card authentication failed.</string>
    <string id="181"><p>We were unable to guess the key (password) for this card. It means the card can have either
    custom key set, or the default card master key set by the card issuer is unique (there is no rule for
    default test keys). Unfortunately, we do not support custom key feature yet. If interested, raise
    github enhancement. Optionally, edit cards.ini file and set correct card key and auth = true.
        <br /> WARNING: do not try again with the same key, or the card will potentially get blocked.</p></string>

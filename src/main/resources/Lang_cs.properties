E_initialized = Card is in initialized state.

H_initialized = This card has been initialized.
E_secure_state = Card is in secured state.
H_secure_state = <p>This card has been secured. This means that the card has been marked as ready to work in hostile environment. We cannot work with such a card and the transformation process is irreversible.</p>
E_locked = Card is in locked state.
H_locked = <p>Card is in locked state. It means that no management alternations can be performed and no other applet or security domain can be selected - the card can run only one selected applet. We cannot work with such a card and the transformation process is irreversible.</p>
E_terminated = Card is in terminated state.
H_terminated = <p>Card has been terminated. It means that this card will not respond to almost any command and thus the card is useless. Nor we, nor anyone else can work with such a card and the transformation process is irreversible.</p>
E_no_life_state = Card life cycle state not detected.
H_no_life_state = <p>Card life cycle state can tell us whether the card is ready for installing, deleteing and other management, or whether the card is no longer manageable. We were unable to determine this information and therefore we will not support this card to avoid any possible damage. Re-plugging the card could help, as fetching card info might (rarely) fail.</p>
E_authentication = Card authentication failed.
H_authentication = <p>We were unable to guess the key (password) for this card. It means the card can have either custom key set, or the default card master key set by the card issuer is unique (there is no rule for default test keys). Unfortunately, we do not support custom key feature yet. If interested, raise github enhancement. Optionally, edit cards.ini file and set correct card key and auth = true. <br /> WARNING: do not try again with the same key, or the card will potentially get blocked.</p>
E_communication = Communication with card failed.
E_generic = The following error has occured: 
W_internet = <p>Internet connection failed. The store displayed is the last saved store version. The store data might not be accurate.</p>
E_install_not_found = <p>Unable to find requested file for install. Try to re-download the store or choose different version or sdk.</p>
E_pkg_present = Package already present on this card. It can be re-installed using advanced 'force install' option.
E_no_reponse = Card is not responding
E_card_no_response = Communication with card failed. Either the card is not responding or hardware failure occurred. You can try to re-plug the card.

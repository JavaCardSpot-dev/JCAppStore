<h1> JCAppStore basic information </h1>

<h2> How the store works? </h2>
<p><b>This application is only a tool for card management. It will not allow you to use the card
    applications themselves.</b> That is, the applet use is not something this application can be used for.
    But the use section in store applet info will help you with the beginning. </p>
<p>
    Also, in the right upper corner, browse help for more detailed description.
    Full documentation is accessible in [TODO] </p>

<h2> Basic terms (not exact, but a lot easier to understand to) </h2>

<h4>Applet</h4>
<p>Applet is the software running on your card. You can think of it as a synonym for application. Applet identifier is
    often called AID.</p>
<br>
<h4>Main applet</h4>
<p>Main applet is the default application running. Rarely, some applets require to be main in order to work. Most likely
    you will not have any applet as a main.</p>
<br>
<h4>Package</h4>
<p>Package is a context for applet. The applets or applications are installed from a package. Package can have more
    applets active.</p>
<br>
<h4>Security domain</h4>
<p>It is a card manager. It is also an applet.</p>
<br>
<h4>Master key</h4>
<p>Master key is the key that is required from you by a card manager (security domain). Without the key, you
    can't modify (e.g. install, delete..) the card contents. The master key is not a PIN or a card password you are used
    to. The key may be one single long sequence, or it can consist
    of three parts. See https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/wiki/Keys. You need not to change the master
    key.</p>
<br>
<h4>Host application</h4>
<p>The applet on a card needs to communicate with something on your computer. Most applets do not have
    these hosts and thus are very difficult to use. The store does not offer such software.

    There are two types of host applications - with GUI and without.
    For host applications that can be used through command line only (without GUI) see guide 'Command line'
    in the app help section (right upper corner). GUI host should be intuitive.</p>
